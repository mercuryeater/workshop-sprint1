        <p className="card__info__description">
          My name is Federico, I'm a visual Artist entering the world of web
          development and programming, I'm still learning but in the future I'm
          going to find a way to integrate my art's background into this world.
          Oh, what else? I have two cats.
        </p>
        <h3 className="card__info__titleList">What I learned</h3>
        <ol className="card__info__list">
          <li className="card__info__list__item">
            With this exercise I reinforced my knowledge about components, props
            and states, even about useEffect, you may not see it in the final
            code but in the process I did a lot of trial and error.
          </li>
          <li className="card__info__list__item">
            Also it was my first time using a library I searched on my own, I
            used it for the timer but the first time didn't work because I used
            and old library that wasn't up to date with my react version, I had
            to change it to make it work.
          </li>
          <li className="card__info__list__item">
            At the same time this was a good practice of the update of "react
            router" with the new way fo create routes with the RouterProvider,
            then the createBrowserRouter and finally the useLoader data to fetch
            the data from the API, avoiding the use of a useEffect. I liked it,
            however as the old way to do it keeps being the most used I'll opt
            for that one the next time.
