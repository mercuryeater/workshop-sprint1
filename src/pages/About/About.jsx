          My name is Federico, I'm a visual Artist entering the world of web
          development and programming, I'm still learning but in the future I'm
          going to find a way to integrate my art's background into this world.
          Oh, what else? I have two cats.

            With this exercise I reinforced my knowledge about components, props
            and states, even about useEffect, you may not see it in the final
            code but in the process I did a lot of trial and error.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also it was my first time using a library I searched on my own, I
            used it for the timer but the first time didn't work because I used
            and old library that wasn't up to date with my react version, I had
            to change it to make it work.
